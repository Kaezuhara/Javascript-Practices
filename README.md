Started self-learning JavaScript using SuperSimpleDev's tutorial on February 18, 2026 while in my Second Year as a BSIT Student at PUP Sta. Mesa, Manila.
Days after making Facebook Homepage Clone using HTML and CSS only, I moved on to learning JavaScript.

In our curriculum in the university, we are also being taught MySQL and Java.
I am also learning these languages by myself online this second semester other than Javascript: (MySQL, Java, Python, +Figma)
Moreover, I started my scholarship at DataCamp on February 19, 2026 to study (self-learn) multiple courses/languages every day to hit a threshold and maintain scholarship to learn courses for free.
Thus, at the time of writing this, I am STUDYING MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SIMULTANEOUSLY, both self-learned and instructed.
